# Rocket-Grid
Mixins for an easy and lightweight grid system requiring no markup. Fixed gutter width and margins are responsive.

## About Rocket Grid
This is a LESS [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) mixin (Sass coming soon) which creates rows and columns for your build without adding extra markup to your HTML. You can set the number of columns, the width of the columns, and the width of the gutters between columns. Everything is responsive too.

The idea for this came from [Semantic.gs](http://semantic.gs/) but I needed a solution that would support fixed width gutters while still being responsive. I also like solutions to be responsive by default. This is the result.
